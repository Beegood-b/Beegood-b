<div align="center"><h5>About Me 💁‍♂️</h5>
Hello! I'm <strong>Artjoms</strong>—pleasure to meet you!👋🏻<br />
Currently, I'm navigating the challenges of a managerial role at an IT company specializing in online casino services.<br />
However, this role doesn't quite encapsulate my ultimate dream. While my daily responsibilities involve multitasking and PC operations,<br />
the heart of my ambition lies in <strong>programming.</strong>

Beyond the demands of management, I devote substantial time to learning <em>Frontend</em> and staying abreast of emerging technologies. My unwavering commitment to self-education is a testament to my belief that, in due time, I will transition into the fulfilling role of a experienced <em>Web Developer.</em></div>

<div align="center"><h5>My Coding Journey 👨‍💻</h5>
<details>I immersed myself in programming world back in April 2023. I've started my journey with Python as it was one of the most commonly discussed programming languages in my circle. At that moment, I didn't yet know that there were various directions in programming, and I didn't understand which path to choose. After writing my very first colorised calculator and several days of researching, my creative side led me to fall in love with frontend development. Shortly after I applied for the web development courses at ITLAT, where they taught me the basics of programming. I graduated with a certificate and started to seek for opportunities simultaneously writing a code and keeping to learn everyday.</details>
